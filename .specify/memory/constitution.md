# OptiMeal Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Intuitive AI-Powered Frontend
The user interface will be designed to be highly intuitive and user-friendly, leveraging AI agents and advanced text processing to simplify user interactions and reduce cognitive load. A seamless and simple user experience is critical for user adoption and retention. By using AI to abstract away complexity, we can make powerful features accessible to a broader audience.

### II. Rigorous Mathematical & Economic Modeling
The core optimization engine will be built upon a strong foundation of mathematical and economic theory. All optimization algorithms must be well-researched, documented, and validated. The unique value proposition of OptiMeal is its ability to provide mathematically optimal meal plans, which requires a rigorous and defensible approach to modeling to ensure the recommendations are accurate and trustworthy.

### III. Modular & Composable Architecture
The system will be designed with a modular architecture, where each component (e.g., frontend, optimization engine, data processing) can operate independently but also communicate effectively with other components. The user experience should allow for toggling the integration of these components. A modular architecture promotes scalability, maintainability, and flexibility, allowing for independent development and deployment of components and enabling a more customizable user experience.

## Governance
This constitution is the single source of truth for project principles. All development, specifications, and plans must align with it. Amendments require team consensus, documentation of the change, and a version bump.
